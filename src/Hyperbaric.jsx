                Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy or “HBOT” is a prescribed treatment
                approved by the FDA and AMA in which a patient breathes 100%
                medical grade oxygen while under increased pressure. During
                treatment the patient can relax by watching a movie, listening
                to music or just rest. It is a non-invasive, safe method of
                administering pure oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure
                to a patient in order to improve or correct certain conditions
                or to increase recovery speed.

              When experiencing challenges in reaching your wound care goals,
              seeking additional support can make a significant difference,
              especially if you're uncertain about the factors affecting your
              healing process. Some diagnosis qualify for HBO therapy. For
              decades, hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) has often been part of the
              treatment of diagnosis such as osteoradionecrosis, soft tissue
              radionecrosis, osteomyelitis, diabetic foot ulcers and more!

            <h2> Benefits of HBOT </h2>
            <p>
              Many health conditions and injuries struggle to heal effectively
              when oxygen levels are insufficient. Factors such as diminished
              blood flow, swelling, and inflammation can create conditions where
              the necessary oxygen for tissue repair is scarce.
              <br /> <br />
              Using a pressurized chamber to deliver oxygen can vastly improve
              the situation, providing 10 to 15 times more oxygen than would be
              available at normal atmospheric pressure. Hyperbaric Oxygen
              Therapy (HBOT) facilitates the absorption of oxygen into various
              bodily fluids, including plasma, lymphatic fluid, and
              cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord. This
              increased oxygen supply can penetrate areas with limited or
              obstructed circulation, either by bypassing blockages or directly
              reaching the affected tissues. Enhanced oxygen levels assist in
              the healing process by strengthening the immune response,
              fostering the development of new capillaries, and supporting the
              formation of new connective tissue.
