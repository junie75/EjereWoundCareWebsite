For individuals suffering from **chronic wounds**, the choice between **traditional wound care** and **hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)** can be overwhelming. Understanding the differences can help in making an informed decision.

## Traditional Wound Care Approaches
Conventional wound care includes:
- Cleaning and debridement
- Dressings and bandages
- Antibiotics (if infection is present)
- Pressure relief (offloading)

While these methods are effective, some wounds **fail to heal** due to **poor circulation** or **low oxygen levels**.

## When to Consider HBOT
HBOT is recommended when:
- Wounds show **slow or no improvement** with standard care
- There is **poor blood supply** to the affected area
- The wound is complicated by **infection, diabetes, or radiation damage**

## Key Differences
| Factor               | Traditional Wound Care | HBOT |
|----------------------|----------------------|------|
| **Oxygen Delivery**  | Normal air (21% oxygen) | 100% pure oxygen under pressure |
| **Effect on Healing** | Gradual | Accelerated healing |
| **Infection Control** | Limited | Strong antibacterial effects |

## Key Differences

| Factor               | Traditional Wound Care           | HBOT                                     |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Oxygen Delivery**  | Normal air (21% oxygen)       | 100% pure oxygen under pressure         |
| **Effect on Healing** | Gradual                      | Accelerated healing                     |
| **Infection Control** | Limited                      | Strong antibacterial effects            |


## Conclusion
For **non-healing wounds**, **hyperbaric oxygen therapy** may be the key to faster and more effective healing. Talk to a wound care specialist to see if HBOT is right for you.
