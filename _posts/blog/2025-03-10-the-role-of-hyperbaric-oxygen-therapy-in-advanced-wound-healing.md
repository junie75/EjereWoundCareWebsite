title: The Role of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy in Advanced Wound Healing
description: Wound healing is a complex process that requires optimal
  oxygenation to repair damaged tissue. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) is an
  advanced treatment that enhances wound healing, especially for chronic and
  non-healing wounds.

## How Does HBOT Work?

HBOT involves breathing pure oxygen in a pressurized chamber, increasing oxygen levels in the bloodstream and tissues. This process:

* Stimulates collagen production
* Reduces swelling and inflammation
* Enhances white blood cell function
* Promotes the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis)

## Conditions That Benefit from HBOT

HBOT is particularly effective for:

* **Diabetic foot ulcers**
* **Pressure sores**
* **Radiation-induced wounds**
* **Burns and surgical wounds with poor healing**

## Conclusion

For patients struggling with **chronic wounds**, HBOT offers a scientifically backed approach to accelerate healing and prevent complications. If you're considering HBOT, consult with a wound care specialist to explore its benefits.
