## How Does HBOT Work?
HBOT involves breathing pure oxygen in a pressurized chamber, increasing oxygen levels in the bloodstream and tissues. This process:
- Stimulates collagen production
- Reduces swelling and inflammation
- Enhances white blood cell function
- Promotes the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis)
## Conditions That Benefit from HBOT
HBOT is particularly effective for:
- **Diabetic foot ulcers**
- **Pressure sores**
- **Radiation-induced wounds**
- **Burns and surgical wounds with poor healing**
## Conclusion
For patients struggling with **chronic wounds**, HBOT offers a scientifically backed approach to accelerate healing and prevent complications. If you're considering HBOT, consult with a wound care specialist to explore its benefits.
