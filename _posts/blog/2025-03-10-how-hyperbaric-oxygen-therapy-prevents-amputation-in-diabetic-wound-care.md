## Why Diabetic Wounds Are Hard to Heal
Diabetes affects circulation and nerve function, leading to:
- **Reduced blood flow** to extremities
- **Poor oxygenation** of tissues
- **Higher infection risk**
- **Slow wound healing**

## How HBOT Helps Save Limbs
By increasing oxygen levels in the blood and tissues, HBOT:
✅ Stimulates new blood vessel growth  
✅ Reduces inflammation and swelling  
✅ Kills bacteria and enhances immune response  
✅ Promotes faster tissue regeneration  

## Real-World Impact
Studies show that **diabetic patients** who receive HBOT experience a **higher wound closure rate** and a **reduced risk of amputation**.

## Conclusion
If you or a loved one is facing a **non-healing diabetic wound**, talk to a wound care specialist about incorporating **Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy** into the treatment plan. Early intervention can make a life-changing difference.
